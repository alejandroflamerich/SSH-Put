SSH Put — Upload Open Files

Quickly upload all files currently open in VS Code to a remote server over SSH/SFTP. Configure the server, remote path, user and password with an interactive assistant, then upload visible files preserving their workspace-relative paths. Shows progress, logs to an output channel, and preserves timestamps and permissions to reduce false positives in file-sync tools.

Lightweight, reliable, and designed for fast iteration when deploying small changes.
